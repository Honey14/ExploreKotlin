    <string name="details">NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Friday took exception to Jawaharlal Nehru University’s contempt plea that lacked academic details of the students against whom it wanted the court to take action.
“It is shocking you file a contempt and you don’t know anything about the students, one of whom was convicted for contempt last year also,” Justice A K Chawla said, while asking JNU to file an affidavit giving details of the students named in the contempt petition, with the courses they are enrolled in, status and duration of stay on the campus.
The university has filed a contempt petition against a section of students for protesting within 100 metres of its administrative block.
“You only know the room numbers (of the students),” the court said, after the registrar of JNU and other officials, present in the hearing, could not give details about one of the students who was allegedly held guilty of contempt by the high court for protesting near the administrative block last year.
“How long she has been studying there? Shouldn’t the registrar know? Is that not a basic thing? Do you know which course she or others are studying? No? Why not,” the court asked after JNU’s counsel Monika Arora could only claim that the student was last year held guilty of contempt.</string>
